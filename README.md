Recall gives GitHub Copilot a persistent, searchable memory that survives across sessions. It searches prior knowledge before reading files, saves discoveries after solving problems, and indexes every function in your codebase. Everything stays local. No cloud dependencies.

**Measured result: 91% fewer tokens consumed in returning-to-codebase tasks.** Instead of re-reading thousands of lines, Copilot retrieves a few observations and reads only the lines it needs. The extension tracks your actual savings in real time so you can verify for yourself.

See [docs/benchmark-methodology.md](docs/benchmark-methodology.md) for methodology and [benchmarks/](benchmarks/) for reproducible scenarios.

## Quick Start

Install the extension, then run one command:

```bash
# From the VS Code Marketplace
code --install-extension recall-dev.recall

# Or from a .vsix file
code --install-extension recall-1.3.0.vsix --force
```

Set up your repository so Copilot knows how to use Recall:

```
Ctrl+Shift+P > "Recall: Setup Repository (Add Copilot Guidance Files)"
```

That's it. Reload VS Code and start working. Recall builds memory automatically from here.

---

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Memory** - Copilot searches and saves on its own. No manual @commands needed.
- **Hybrid Search** - SQLite FTS5 keyword search combined with 384-dim sentence-transformer embeddings for semantic matching.
- **File Index** - Every source file gets a cached function listing. Copilot reads 80 lines instead of 8,000.
- **Passive Capture** - Builds, debug sessions, git commits, and idle notes are logged automatically.
- **Trust System** - AI claims stay "pending" until you verify them. Objective events are auto-verified.
- **Deduplication** - Clusters near-identical observations by semantic similarity. One-click merge.
- **Import / Export** - Share memory across machines or with teammates via JSON.
- **Fully Private** - Bundled ONNX model (~23 MB). Local SQLite. Zero network calls. Zero telemetry.
- **Token Savings Tracker** - Built-in metrics show tokens consumed vs tokens saved. Real numbers, not estimates.
- **Dashboard** - Sidebar panel with stats, pending reviews, file index, token savings, and tag breakdowns.

## How It Works

```
  Without Recall:                          With Recall:

  Copilot --read_file--> 7,854 lines      Copilot --recall_search--> 3 prior observations
    ^                        |                |
    |      ~55,000 tokens    |             recall_file_index -> function listing (800 tokens)
    <------------------------+                |
                                           read_file lines 130-195 only (500 tokens)
                                              |
                                           recall_save -> saved for next session
```

Recall registers three Language Model Tools that Copilot calls autonomously, the same way it calls `read_file` or `grep_search`:

| Tool | What Copilot Does With It |
|---|---|
| `recall_search` | Searches memory for prior observations before deep-diving into code |
| `recall_save` | Saves bug root causes, fixes, and architectural insights |
| `recall_file_index` | Looks up cached function listings to read only specific lines |

### Example Session

```
You type: "Fix the token refresh race condition in auth"

Copilot (behind the scenes):
  1. recall_search("token refresh race condition auth")
     > 3 prior observations from past sessions

  2. recall_file_index("authService.ts")
     > summary + 12 functions with line numbers (400 tokens)

  3. read_file authService.ts lines 130-195
     > only the 2 functions it needs (500 tokens)

  4. Makes the fix

  5. recall_save("Fixed token refresh race condition...")
     > saved as 'pending' for you to verify
```

---

## Privacy & Data

Recall is designed to be fully offline and private:

- **Storage**: Single SQLite file at `~/.recall/recall.db` on your machine
- **Semantic model**: Bundled ~23 MB ONNX model runs in-process. No API calls.
- **Network**: Zero. No telemetry, no cloud sync, no data leaves your machine.
- **Backup**: Copy `recall.db`. That's it.
- **Reset**: Delete `~/.recall/recall.db`. A fresh database is created on next activation.

---

## System Requirements

- **VS Code**: 1.95 or higher (with Copilot Agent mode support)
- **Node.js**: 22+ (for building from source)
- **Copilot**: Any plan that supports Agent mode (Business, Enterprise, or Individual)
- **Disk**: ~25 MB for the extension + model. Database typically stays under 10 MB.

---

## Repository Setup

After installing, teach Copilot how to use Recall in your project:

```
Ctrl+Shift+P > "Recall: Setup Repository (Add Copilot Guidance Files)"
```

This creates:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Teaches Copilot the search, index, read, save workflow |
| `.github/agents/recall.agent.md` | Dedicated memory-first agent mode |
| `.github/instructions/recall-aware.instructions.md` | Auto-triggers on any source file |
| `.github/prompts/recall-seed.prompt.md` | One-time prompt to populate baseline memory |
| `.github/prompts/recall-audit.prompt.md` | Monthly maintenance prompt |

**Commit these files** so the whole team benefits.

### Seeding Memory (Cold Start)

When the database is empty, bootstrap it:

1. Run `Recall: Setup Repository` from the Command Palette
2. In Copilot Chat, open `recall-seed.prompt.md`
3. Specify a module (e.g., "auth, all files in src/services/auth/")
4. Copilot walks the codebase building baseline observations
5. Repeat for each major module (~10-30 min each)

---

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KhouryEthan/Recall.git
cd Recall
npm install
npm run compile
```

Press `F5` in VS Code to launch the Extension Development Host.

### Building

```bash
npm run bundle          # Bundle with esbuild
npm run package         # Create .vsix (universal, all platforms)
```

Since v1.3.0, the extension uses WebAssembly SQLite. No native build tools needed.

## FAQ

**Does Recall send any data to the cloud?**
No. Everything runs locally. Zero network calls.

**Does it work with Copilot Business/Enterprise?**
Yes. LM tools and chat participant APIs work with any Copilot plan that supports Agent mode.

**Can I share my memory with the team?**
Export to JSON, then teammates import with duplicate detection.

**How big does the database get?**
Typically under 10 MB even after months of heavy use.

**Does it slow down VS Code?**
No. All database operations are under 1ms. File indexing runs asynchronously on save.
